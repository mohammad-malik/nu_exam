option: private

b94d27b
Method overloading is a way of achieving polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

b94d27b
Method overriding involves creating a new method in the subclass that has the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass.
option dabfac4: True
option: False

88f7ace
Discuss the concept of polymorphism and how it is implemented in Object-Oriented Programming. Provide examples to illustrate your explanation.

option: True
option dabfac4: False

b94d27b
The final block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
option dabfac4: True
option: False
